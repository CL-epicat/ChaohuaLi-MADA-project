# Exploratory analysis
'Rate2': age-adjusted all-cause mortality rate

'pcp_100k': primary care physician supply per 100,000 population

'metro': metropolitan status of the county

'hispanic_pct': proportion of county population that are Hispanic

'NHB_pct': proportion of county population that are Non-Hispanic  Black

'noHS_pct': proportion of county population without a high school diploma

'poverty_pct': proportion of county population living under federal poverty line

'unemployed_pct': proportion of county population that are unemployed

'uninsured_pct': proportion of county population without health insurance

```

From the histograms, we can tell the distribution for the outcome (mortality rate) is fairly normal. Distributions for PCP supply, %Hispanic and %NH-Black are very skewed. We probably have to log-transform PCP supply.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic2
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of Mortality Rate and Log(PCP Supply)."
#| echo: FALSE 
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","exploratory","rate_pcp1.png"))
```

There seems to be a linear relationship between Mortality Rate and log(PCP supply). Linear regression might be suitable for analysis.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic3
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of Mortality Rate and Log(PCP Supply) by Metro Status."
#| echo: FALSE 
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","exploratory","rate_pcp2.png"))
```

The relationship looks similar for the metro and non-metro counties. Maybe there is no interaction by metro status.

#| label: tbl-schematic2
#| tbl-cap: "Correlations among covariates."
#| echo: FALSE
corrtable=readRDS(here("results","exploratory","correlation_table.rds"))
knitr::kable(corrtable)
```

The correlations among the covariates are relatively low. We can keep all the covariates for modeling.
