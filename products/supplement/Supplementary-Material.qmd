# Exploratory analysis
'Rate2': age-adjusted all-cause mortality rate

'pcp_100k': primary care physician supply per 100,000 population

'metro': metropolitan status of the county

'hispanic_pct': proportion of county population that are Hispanic

'NHB_pct': proportion of county population that are Non-Hispanic  Black

'noHS_pct': proportion of county population without a high school diploma

'poverty_pct': proportion of county population living under federal poverty line

'unemployed_pct': proportion of county population that are unemployed

'uninsured_pct': proportion of county population without health insurance

```

From the histograms, we can tell the distribution for the outcome (mortality rate) is fairly normal. Distributions for PCP supply, %Hispanic and %NH-Black are very skewed. We probably have to log-transform PCP supply.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic2
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of Mortality Rate and Log(PCP Supply)."
#| echo: FALSE 
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","exploratory","rate_pcp1.png"))
```

There seems to be a linear relationship between Mortality Rate and log(PCP supply). Linear regression might be suitable for analysis.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic3
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of Mortality Rate and Log(PCP Supply) by Metro Status."
#| echo: FALSE 
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","exploratory","rate_pcp2.png"))
```

The relationship looks similar for the metro and non-metro counties. Maybe there is no interaction by metro status.

#| echo: FALSE
corrtable=readRDS(here("results","exploratory","correlation_table.rds"))
knitr::kable(corrtable)
```

The correlations among the covariates are relatively low. We can keep all the covariates for modeling.

# Model Performance

  Model 1: Linear mixed effect model: log_PCP as the only predictor - RMSE=358, R-squared=0.05
  
  Model 2: Linear mixed effect model: log_PCP and all covariates    - RMSE=292, R-squared=0.37
  
  Model 3: Random Forest Model           - RMSE=248, R-squared=0.54.

```


```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic5
#| fig-cap: "Residuals vs Predicted Values by Models."
#| echo: FALSE 
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","analysis","residual_plot.png"))
```

For Model 3, the data points are generally scattered around the diagonal line and the predicted values are closer to the observed values than the data points for Model 1 and Model 2. Thus, the random forest model can predict the outcome better than the other two models.

But since the random forest model results are not as interpretable as the results from linear mixed effect models, I decide to report results for both model 2(linear mixed effect model) and model 3 (random forest). The point of reporting results from model 2 is that the parameter estimates can tell us how the mortality rate is related to the PCP supply.
